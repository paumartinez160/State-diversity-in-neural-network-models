# State-diversity-in-neural-network-models
This is the repository of my final degree project in Physics where it can be seen the code used for the simulations of the spiking neural network model.

In this repository you can see 2 different codes. The .py is the code to do all the simulations needed to study a certain configuration that is an initial condition. The notebook .ipynb is the code applyied in Final_simulation.py explained
